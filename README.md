### Getting Started

Stencil Utils is written in ES6 and is currently transpiled to ES5 with babel for running client side within browsers.
Stencil utils can either be imported to your theme as a module, or included as a standalone script.

### Installing Stencil Utils on your theme

test 
#### As an ES6 module

* Run `npm install @bigcommerce/stencil-utils` to install the latest tagged version of stencil-utils for use with your theme.
* Import the library `import utils from 'bigcommerce/stencil-utils';` in modules that depend on it.

#### Using standalone

If you do not want to support es6 modules, Stencil Utils can be included as a normal script:

* Copy the bundled script from `dist/stencil-utils.min.js` to your theme.
* Include the script in your HTML document
* Access stencil utils from `window.stencilUtils`.

Now you are playing with power!

#### Testing

Just simply run `npm run test`
